/**
 * These are the JUnit test that accompany my attempts at implementing
 * some advanced data structures.
 * So far you will find a balanced tree class and a balanced set class
 * and an Iterator that can be used with both.
 * Both of which are based on the B-tree described in Chapter 10 of 
 * "Data Structures and Other Objects Using Java" by Michael Main.
 * I plan on adding more to this package as time progresses.
